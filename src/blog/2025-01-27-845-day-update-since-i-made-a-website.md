Well, hello there!

Since I first published this site, in October 2022 - yes that long ago there have been some updates.

I publish 2 articles, the first one about [ensuring the focus appearance of focusable elements is accessible](https://www.seanelliott.au/blog/2024-05-16-is-your-focus-appearance-accessible/) and the other about [leveraging React Testing Library for accessibility testing](https://www.seanelliott.au/blog/2024-12-27-catching-accessibility-issues-early-with-react-testing-library/).

Not a lot in terms of blogging, mainly little updates here and there to improve things with the built or bump versions of dependancies.

But recently I got really stuck into optimising the site. 

Im not sure what started this maybe because I've circled back to an idea I had years ago that my personal site would have a resume section, which potential recruiters could visit and then print, so leveraging some awesome print css wizardry and I wouldn't need to have a word doc anymore buuuuut, thats still a work in progress.

But I can tell you about 3 weeks ago I really got stuck in, a quick summary:

* Updated all dependencies to latest version - eleventy is now at v3 so that required a bit of work
* Removed SASS and went vanilla CSS - with a little bit of PostCSS
* Started using Yarn - honestly I thought I was but based off my commits that wasnt the case
