    <h2>Whats going on here...?</h2>

    <p>Well I figured it was about damn time I made myself a website. Ive attempted this a few times but for several
      reasons I've never gotten close to finishing (sometimes even starting).</p>

    <p>On reflection I can break it down to a few things, one is my own damn perfectionism. Ive always started with
      designing the look and feel before doing anything else. The aim has always been designing the best developer
      blog/website there is straight away... well I suck at design and what does the best mean to me... even when I was
      designing as part of my job and thought i was good, I still sucked so I never got very far.
    </p>
    <p>Then there is my stubbon pride, this is maybe the worst part. This is where I just cant bring myself to just buy
      a theme or template and skin it. There is some little voice in my head that makes me think im a terrible developer
      if I cant do it myself. Btw all power to developers who do use templates, im just a stubbon idiot and this is no
      reflection on you at all.</p>
    <p>The final nail in the Sean website coffin <s>is</s> was the technology, as much as I love vanilla html and css,
      its a pain in the ass to have to manaually create content pages and update recenty article list blaaah blah blah
      everything.
      <br /> "But Sean, Why dont you use a CMS?" I hear you say. I know theres plenty of CMS's out there, Ive built
      heaps of sites using free and paid ones throughout my career, but when it comes to adding one to my website its
      got to be so simple to get up and going. Even when I was doing the CMS set up and
      integration myself for a company and had it all down to a "fine art", any little problem with my set up and the
      Sean website train derails into a firey miserable mess and I give up - CHOO CHOO CRASH.
    </p>
    <p>But now things have gotten crazy good out there, static sites are back in fashion, headless cms are this amazing
      thing that exisits!</p>
    <p>So this is me starting my personal website journey again.</p>

    <h3>How I plan to power this site.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> as the static site generator, almost zero config which is amazing!
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> because I like it and wanted some more "advanced" css stuff</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netflify CMS</a> as
        the headless CMS of choice and build and publish tool</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> where my code will live</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thats the core of this website at the moment it might change depending what problems I have but so far so good...
    </p>

    <h3>What about the design?</h3>

    <p>Good question do you like it? Ive gone for a minimilist approach I call it "Almost Browser Default" its
      the newest design everyone will want. But in all seriousness, im going to keep it simple and slowly chip away. The
      beauty of HTML and CSS is that with some basic markup and structure I should be able to "theme" this site without
      to much rebuilding of the underlying mark up. Plus whats more accessible then text on a page?
    </p>

    <p>So keep checking in, im hoping to make some changes at a consistent pace. If you dont see any changes in a while
      maybe reach
      out and check in with me and make sure the Sean website train is still on the tracks.</p>
