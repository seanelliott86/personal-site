      <p>Welcome to the digital diary of a self-taught frontend UI developer on a mission for an accessible web!</p>

      <p>As a developer, I got into accessibility the wrong way, by building inaccessible sites. I quickly learnt from
        first-hand experience that, the hard way to do accessibility is riiiight at the end. Ever since that painful,
        dreadful, earth-shattering time in my life, I've pushed for accessibility to be considered from the start. But
        accessibility is not all about the code, it starts a lot earlier than that. It begins at the top and then
        progresses through anyone tasked with delivering a project.</p>

      <p>With this blog, I'm not here to drown you in a sea of HTML tags or get lost in the jungle of CSS. No, no! This
        blog is where we chat about making the web a friendlier place for everyone, regardless of how our users browse,
        click, or tap.</p>

      <p>Get ready to learn, view at a few well placed Simpsons GIFs and probably deal with some over the top rants.
        Because on this blog I believe that making the web accessible can be an easy and enjoyable process. Stick
        around, and let's make the internet a place where everyone feels at home!</p>
