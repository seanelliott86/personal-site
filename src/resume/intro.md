I am a Frontend UI Developer and Web Accessibility Specialist at Service NSW, bringing over 16 years of expertise in frontend web technology. With a deep passion for accessibility and creating inclusive user experiences, I’ve spent the last 8 years specialising in component libraries and design systems across various projects. For the past year and a half, I’ve led the engineering efforts at Service NSW GEL team, steering the transition to a monorepo architecture with the developers and working with the entire design system team to roll out a new brand theme.

Before rejoining Service NSW, I contributed to the Lendi UI Design System team, launched the NSW Digital Design System, and worked on Bunnings' E-commerce platform, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver cart and payment components that enhanced the shopping experience.
