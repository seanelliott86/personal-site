Upon rejoining Service NSW, my main focus was to lead the engineering team in a major overhaul of the Service NSW GEL component library, transitioning it to a monorepo architecture. Alongside these technical improvements, we were responsible for rolling out a new NSW brand-compliant theme across the organization. In addition to upgrading components and addressing support requests, I took on a proactive role in improving accessibility across teams. This involved leading accessibility initiatives beyond my core responsibilities, such as presenting in guilds and conducting lunch-and-learn sessions to foster accessibility awareness and best practices.

The Service NSW GEL is built with a modern tech stack, including React (TypeScript), Styled Components, React Testing Library, JEST, Axe, TurboRepo, and Changesets.
